The Flappy Bird game built with Python and Flask is a web-based version of the classic arcade game, where players control a bird to navigate through pipes without colliding. The game logic is handled using Python, and Flask serves as the web framework to host the game on a web interface, allowing players to enjoy the game via a browser.
